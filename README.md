# Jordy Pickel Work Samples

In many of these projects, I've included the development files (or theme files for CMS-based development). For some, I have also included the static ripped website so that you can review the live version of the website.

For other projects that do not have a ripped version, I have included the live link for you to see the website.

## Development

These are the projects I've worked on most recently. Some are currently under development and have not yet been launched.

* __FVM__ - I am currently rebuilding our corporate website with the Bootstrap framework. In this recode I also consolidated all of the pages and styles that have been developed over the years into a more streamlined SASS codebase.
* __Philly Gear__ - This is a landing page I recently developed for a national B2B gear manufacturer.
* __Avenu__ - Our company recently rebranded this government-focused company and I developed their website. This website was built in a quick turnaround, and was largely possible due to the arrangement of custom templates I built into the CMS. Each page can be created with a blank slate, but have any combination of components added to it. The fields try and remove all user error. Some screenshots are included of the backend.
* __thePickel__ - This is my personal development website.
* __NECA__ - The Northeastern Chemical Association is a non-profit that raises scholarship money for college students. This website has an in-depth logged in area that includes a member directory, profiles, online applications, event registration, PayPal integration, administrative tools to approve managers and send out custom email responses, etc. I've included some screenshots of those private pages and can walk you through any of the processes that were put in place.
* __PRA__ - This is a project that is currently underway. It is a small brochure website. This code is about 40% finished, development-wise. There is still a lot of page building to be done in the CMS. I have also included the digital style guide I'm putting together.
* * __Univar PestWorld Tour__ - At their biggest trade show of the year, Univar set up their booth with a table of Chromebooks. I coded a walkthrough to be used as a sales support tool for when the reps were speaking with customers.

## Documents

* [__PestWeb Site Architecture__] (documents/pestweb-site-architecture.pdf) - For this website redesign, our team laid out an in-depth discovery and planning phase. We interviewed more than fifty marketing personnel, customer sales reps, field reps, technicians, and business owners in order to determine the offerings people used most and when. We also aligned Univar's core mission to its offerings, and slimmed down the website in order to focus solely on what Univar does best.
* [__Clery Center Site Architecture__] (documents/clery-center-site-architecture.pdf) - Clery Center's offerings had expanded over the years to the point that they were doing too much, pulling focus away from their core mission. I helped restructure their website to provide the most relevant information first, in an organized manner.
* [__Lightpath Site Architecture__] (documents/lightpath-site-architecture.pdf) - Lightpath's service offerings were so splintered that it appeared they sold four times as many services as they actually did. My goal was to begin outlining their core offerings and subservices into easy-to-understand buckets.

## CodePens

* [__Floating Labels__] (https://codepen.io/psuhiker/pen/KoqNRB) - This is a script I've used on several websites, including the FVM files in this repo.
* [__Animated Logo__] (https://codepen.io/psuhiker/pen/mxLWgO)
