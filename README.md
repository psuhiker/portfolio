# Jordy Pickel Work Samples

In many of these projects, I've included the development files (or theme files for CMS-based development). For some, I have also included the static ripped website so that you can review the live version of the website.

For other projects that do not have a ripped version, I have included the live link for you to see the website.

## Development

These are the projects I've worked on most recently. Some are currently under development and have not yet been launched.

* __FVM__ - I am currently rebuilding our corporate website with the Bootstrap framework. In this recode I also consolidated all of the pages and styles that have been developed over the years into a more streamlined SASS codebase.
* __Philly Gear__ - This is a landing page I recently developed for a national B2B gear manufacturer.
* __Avenu__ - Our company recently rebranded this government-focused company and I developed their website. This website was built in a quick turnaround, and was largely possible due to the arrangement of custom templates I built into the CMS. Each page can be created with a blank slate, but have any combination of components added to it. The fields try and remove all user error. Some screenshots are included of the backend.
* __thePickel__ - This is my personal development website.
* __NECA__ - The Northeastern Chemical Association is a non-profit that raises scholarship money for college students. This website has an in-depth logged in area that includes a member directory, profiles, online applications, event registration, PayPal integration, administrative tools to approve managers and send out custom email responses, etc. I've included some screenshots of those private pages and can walk you through any of the processes that were put in place.
* __PRA__ - This is a project that is currently underway. It is a small brochure website. This code is about 40% finished, development-wise. There is still a lot of page building to be done in the CMS. I have also included the digital style guide I'm putting together.
