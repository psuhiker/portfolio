		<description><![CDATA[The Super Bowl is more than just a game, it&#8217;s a global event.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Super Bowl is more than just a game, it&#8217;s a global event. It&#8217;s the most watched program of the year. Even those who have no idea who the Denver Broncos or the Seattle Seahawks are will tune in. Why? Typically it&#8217;s because everyone else is doing it, but another reason is the advertising. In 2013, the average cost of a 30-second spot was $4 million. The effectiveness of these ads in boosting a company&#8217;s sales has been in question over the past few years. Experts have compared the investment of the cost of an ad vs. overall increased revenue after the Super Bowl, and it shows little to no change. Forbes magazine claims that most companies would be better off airing 10 commercials at $400,000 each, to increase repetition. Forbes also claims that Super Bowl Ads have become memorible for presentation, but forgettable in terms of persuasion.</p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire <a href="http://www.uwec.edu/newsbureau/release/past/2000/00-01/010400super.html">did a study of over 500 Super Bowl spots that ran between 2000 and 2009</a>, and found that many did not work. Some Super Bowl Ads fail due to the fact that people typically recall the story, but not the product. More often than not, Super Bowl ads attempt to deliver broad humor for entertainment purposes, rather than sell the product. Sometimes companies will enlist celebrities to sponsor their Super Bowl Ad, but experts have also concluded this tactic is ineffective as the celebrity may lack relevance to the product. Still the question must be asked, is the Super Bowl ad worth the investment?</p>
<p>Forbes magazine says yes.</p>
<p>The real reason companies invest in Super Bowl spots is because the announcement of buying airtime for the Super Bowl can boost their stock price, at least in the short term. A business will typically announce their Super Bowl buy weeks prior to the big game, and even debut the advertisement early on social sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Experts have found that any positive impact on a businesses stock price comes at the announcement of the Super Bowl spot, not after the spot runs. Whether or not an advertisement is successful is secondary to the impact it has on a business&#8217; exposure in the stock market. So yes, for an enterprise business that can afford the $4,000,000+ on advertising their investment is well worth it.</p>
<p>Whether you watch for the love of the game, advertising, or Peyton Manning––sit back, relax and enjoy the entertainment. It&#8217;ll be a long time until your next fantasy football draft night, and that&#8217;s depressing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ron Burgundy is everywhere!</p>
<p>The promotion of Anchorman 2 was unconventional to say the least. Ron appeared as a band member on Conan O&#8217;Brien, and in numerous Dodge Durango commercials; he attended the MTV VMA awards and even showed up at the Olympic Curling Trials. Most recently he co-hosted a local North Dakota news program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2b5IhzGuMPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>(Ron&#8217;s photo bombs are especially amusing.)</p>
<p>Ben &amp; Jerry even created an ice cream flavor in Ron&#8217;s honor, called “Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r5fBpwo0XmE/Uo_t0nm4cgI/AAAAAAAALv8/vIuUgAgEw0k/s1600/ben%2Bjerrys%2Bron%2Bburgundy%2Bscotchy%2Bscotch%2Bscotch%2Bice%2Bcream%2Bpint.jpg" width="227" height="254" /></p>
<p>Some think all the promotion is too much––they&#8217;ve had enough of Mr. Burgundy.</p>
<p>I think it is pure marketing genius, thinking outside the box of boring commercials, ads, and billboards. I actually watch and enjoy the Dodge commercials, as opposed to my normal habit of changing the channel. Not to mention how viral his videos have gone––all free advertising!</p>
<p>Keep making us laugh Ron!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While watching <i>Deadliest Catch</i> on the Discovery Channel with my husband one night a few months ago, I started noticing a pattern. During every commercial break, we were assaulted with commercials for men’s products: Ford F-150 pickup trucks, razors with four blades for a closer shave, Slim Jims–the list goes on.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud and said, &#8220;Oh man, I guess I&#8217;m not in the target market for <i>this </i>show. I love when that happens! I feel like I&#8217;m beating the system!&#8221; I expected my husband to chuckle and agree. Instead, he looked at me like I had three heads and said, &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>I realized, then, that not everybody in the world notices or pays attention when they&#8217;re being marketed to. For the first time, I felt special as a professional working in marketing.  Over the next few weeks I noticed that I really do find it fun to determine if I am inside or outside the target market for the products or services I&#8217;m being marketed.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a random weekday home sick, I was watching <i>The Price is Right</i> on CBS. Denture cleaner–Nope!  Nice try, marketers, but thankfully I have all my teeth!  Scooter Store–Nope!  Emergency Life Alert button–Nope!  Pampers Cruisers diapers…OK, you got me on that one.  Touché, marketers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Checking my Email: Groupon to Niagra Falls–Nope!  Adidas Men&#8217;s Golf Shoes–Nope!  50% off on preschool portraits…wait, let me see that one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Watching <i>What Not to Wear</i> on TLC, while folding laundry on a Saturday afternoon: OK, I admit, I am 100% in the center circle of TLC&#8217;s target market diagram.  Whatever I see a commercial for, I want to buy, to watch, to check out.  Way to go, TLC, you found me!</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketers have a different way of looking at the world–of breaking down human behavior and trying to understand, at the core, what moves and motivates people. I am happy to consider myself part of this group of professionals. I feel at home in this little world because it&#8217;s really interesting to me. I am also happy that I&#8217;m not tasked with advertising to smart-ass marketers like myself!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Advertising is going to change more in the next 20 years than it has in the last 100,&#8221; <a title="says Chris Taylor of Mashable OP-ED." href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/15/the-future-of-advertising-pay-per-gaze-is-just-the-beginning/" target="_blank">says Chris Taylor of Mashable OP-ED. </a>In recent months Google, the world’s largest search engine provider, was granted a patent for a Google Glass-based ad system known as &#8220;pay-per-gaze.”</p>
<p>Google Glass is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display, which is being developed by Google as part of a mission to produce a mass-market ubiquitous computer.  To operate Google Glass, wearers simply tilt their head 30 degrees upward or tap the touchpad and say, &#8220;O.K., Glass.&#8221;  After the glasses are activated simple requests can be made such as, &#8220;Take a picture”, &#8220;Record a video&#8221;, or &#8220;Send a message to.”  That&#8217;s where &#8220;pay-per-gaze&#8221; comes in.  Google’s &#8220;pay-per-gaze&#8221; would charge advertisers for the number of times someone looks at their ad through Google Glass, the same way pay-per-click works today when users click on a link.  Google Glass contains technology that would track the direction the wearer’s pupils are pointing, and for how long they are gazing at a message.</p>
<p>This technology could potentially be a major risk for Google as people are infinitely exposed to advertising.  The money would flow in endlessly, and advertisers might second-guess themselves and their decision to invest in &#8220;pay-per-gaze.”  Still, this technology is something not even Marty McFly would have imagined.  Personally, I&#8217;ll stick with my Ray Bans.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coca Cola put the brakes on any and all of their advertising spending last Monday in order to help those in need. How does this work? Well, the sugary-sweet beverage company decided to take all the money they would have spent on advertising and pass it along to aid in the relief and rebuilding efforts in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan.</p>
<p>Not only does this story warm the cockles of my heart, but it&#8217;s also nice to see a major business setting such a good example for the rest of the nation (and the world). As a trained &#8220;communicator,&#8221; I&#8217;d venture to guess no one will miss Coke&#8217;s advertisements this holiday season—in fact, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this soda-pushing powerhouse sees an increase in sales as a result of such positive publicity.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This year, I got to make the Thanksgiving turkey.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, I got to make the Thanksgiving turkey. I prepared with two practice rounds in early November, roasting whole chickens for my husband and me. I was ready.</p>
<p>On the big day, as my dad read each instruction for turkey prep–remove gizzards, rinse turkey, pat dry, lay on roasting rack, rub salt–<del cite="mailto:Michael%20Garcia" datetime="2013-12-02T09:23"></del>a refrain began to take shape. “Oh, Jordy normally does that part,” I kept saying.</p>
<p>My mom, supervising from the sidelines had caught on to what my husband, to date, hasn’t. “What exactly do <i>you </i>do to cook if Jordy does all this work?”* Oops, I’d been caught. Caught in the act of being a Modern Family.</p>
<p>With both of us working (and two dogs to care for), the “traditional” roles are thrown out the window in my household. We contribute equally (or so I’ve duped my husband into thinking, hehe) when it comes to the household chores. I do my share, but he has taken on a wide range of household tasks, from cooking, to vacuuming, and (in my greatest victory of all), grocery shopping.  On and on his list goes, our modern roles taking shape before our (and my mother’s) very eyes.</p>
<p>The other group to have caught on to the modern family? Tide detergent. Over the holiday weekend, I watched both a holiday movie marathon on Lifetime AND a thrilling Villanova basketball game (victory over Kansas!) on NBC Sports. I saw more Tide laundry detergent commercials on the latter, clearly targeted towards husbands who help around the house. Slowly, I’ve been noticing these ads cropping up. Their messages are heartwarming and humorous, and I love what Proctor &amp; Gamble has done to get there.</p>
<p>Tide and P&amp;G went right back to the basics. They got to know their audience, all over again. It may not be the same audience it’s been since its introduction 67 years ago, and that’s okay. It is one thing to stay where your audience is–social media, mobile devices, Netflix–but entirely  another thing to truly know who your audience is now and will be down the road. It takes work, it takes research, and it takes the ability to not only accept change but to capitalize on it.</p>
<p>Kudos, Tide. I can’t wait to see what happens next time “laundry detergent” is on the grocery list.</p>
<p>*In case you’ve been wondering, my role in the chicken and turkey cooking comes in once the gross handling of raw fowl is complete, and I can season, stuff, smother it in butter and spices, and place it in the oven.</p>
