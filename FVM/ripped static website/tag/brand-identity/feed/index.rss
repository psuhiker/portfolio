				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everybody who’s flown a lot probably knows an airline’s take off instructions by heart. However, government-required informational videos can be something that enhances your brand, and not just a checkmark on the “must have” list.</p>
<p>Case in point: Delta Airlines’ holiday-themed safety video:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5K9GPJiRLno?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I caught this ad for Sports Authority during a recent Clippers-Thunder game and it tugged at me in a way that few commercials do. I&#8217;m not a Luddite, fanatical holiday shopper, or obsessive sports fan. I just appreciate a nice message that captures something pertinent about our time, and this one does.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual annual slate of electronics, this holiday season sees the arrival of two new video game consoles, which are now released every six years or so. At the same time, culturally we seem to be more and more experiencing a sort of post-tech-explosion malaise. For many people, the honeymoon bliss of social networks and mobile computing is fading and they&#8217;re trying to reconnect with the more organic joys in life.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, this ad from <a href="http://www.factorylabs.com/" target="_blank">Factory Design Lab</a> seems especially well-timed and on-point. So well done, guys. I don&#8217;t have any kids to give basketballs to, but if I did, I&#8217;d have to give it some serious thought.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This year, I got to make the Thanksgiving turkey.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, I got to make the Thanksgiving turkey. I prepared with two practice rounds in early November, roasting whole chickens for my husband and me. I was ready.</p>
<p>On the big day, as my dad read each instruction for turkey prep–remove gizzards, rinse turkey, pat dry, lay on roasting rack, rub salt–<del cite="mailto:Michael%20Garcia" datetime="2013-12-02T09:23"></del>a refrain began to take shape. “Oh, Jordy normally does that part,” I kept saying.</p>
<p>My mom, supervising from the sidelines had caught on to what my husband, to date, hasn’t. “What exactly do <i>you </i>do to cook if Jordy does all this work?”* Oops, I’d been caught. Caught in the act of being a Modern Family.</p>
<p>With both of us working (and two dogs to care for), the “traditional” roles are thrown out the window in my household. We contribute equally (or so I’ve duped my husband into thinking, hehe) when it comes to the household chores. I do my share, but he has taken on a wide range of household tasks, from cooking, to vacuuming, and (in my greatest victory of all), grocery shopping.  On and on his list goes, our modern roles taking shape before our (and my mother’s) very eyes.</p>
<p>The other group to have caught on to the modern family? Tide detergent. Over the holiday weekend, I watched both a holiday movie marathon on Lifetime AND a thrilling Villanova basketball game (victory over Kansas!) on NBC Sports. I saw more Tide laundry detergent commercials on the latter, clearly targeted towards husbands who help around the house. Slowly, I’ve been noticing these ads cropping up. Their messages are heartwarming and humorous, and I love what Proctor &amp; Gamble has done to get there.</p>
<p>Tide and P&amp;G went right back to the basics. They got to know their audience, all over again. It may not be the same audience it’s been since its introduction 67 years ago, and that’s okay. It is one thing to stay where your audience is–social media, mobile devices, Netflix–but entirely  another thing to truly know who your audience is now and will be down the road. It takes work, it takes research, and it takes the ability to not only accept change but to capitalize on it.</p>
<p>Kudos, Tide. I can’t wait to see what happens next time “laundry detergent” is on the grocery list.</p>
<p>*In case you’ve been wondering, my role in the chicken and turkey cooking comes in once the gross handling of raw fowl is complete, and I can season, stuff, smother it in butter and spices, and place it in the oven.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn’t help myself.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn’t help myself. I opened my eyes at 5am one morning, the TV still on from the night before, and what program was on? <em>The Pitch</em>, AMC’s reality show that gives a behind-the-scenes view as two ad agencies vie for a new account. How could I NOT watch?</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3131" alt="0614_fuller-brush2" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/0614_fuller-brush2-147x220.jpg" width="147" height="220" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/0614_fuller-brush2-147x220.jpg 147w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/0614_fuller-brush2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 147px) 100vw, 147px" /></p>
<p>In this case, the account was The Fuller Brush Company. <em>THE</em> Fuller Brush Company! An iconic brand from my childhood whose distribution channel was The Fuller Brush Man (thousands of them, actually) selling door-to-door-to-door-to-door. Seriously.</p>
<p>Fuller, one of America’s oldest and most trusted brands that was once known by every household in America (and according to my mother, “Made the best toilet brush on the planet,”) is now virtually unknown by anyone under the age of 45. With a new owner who just rescued the 100-year-old company from bankruptcy, the agency assignment was to “reboot the brand for the modern market.” Again, who wouldn’t love this show?</p>
<p>Without going blow by blow through the episode, suffice it to say, I found it both entertaining and a bit unbelievable. Particularly the part when both agencies came up with exactly the same “Live Fuller” concept to build their pitches around. Yeah, kinda’ fishy.</p>
<p>Anyway, the question is, how does CEO David Sabin choose between two agencies <em>that just presented the exact same big idea?</em></p>
<p>My answer (and here comes the lesson): Clients don’t choose agencies based on the creative they pitch. They choose agencies based on whether they can imagine trusting the agency’s people with their brand.</p>
<p>Think about your closest relationships, your best friends. The best ones are those who spend the most time with you, expend the most energy on you, appreciate you and love you just the way you are. And more than likely, they are also the ones whom you allow to carefully, kindly, and almost naturally help you grow into a better version of yourself. Because they are the ones you trust.</p>
<p>In my view, the Monogram agency didn’t win because of their creative execution. They won because they showed the client he could trust them because they took the time to understand. They spent time on research and then shared their views of potential new customers; they first understood and then echoed the client’s love of The Fuller Brush Man icon while recommending a modern makeover; and they even showed personal empathy and appreciation for the quality of the brand by mentioning using a Fuller hairbrush for over 50 years.</p>
<p>Monogram got it. They understood that the pitch wasn’t about the idea, the destination. It was about their process, their journey to understanding – recounting what they did, what they learned and then what they recommended based on years of experience and expertise.</p>
<p>Monogram got it all &#8212; the brand, the client’s trust, and the account.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Lunch at Chipotle is always awesome.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lunch at Chipotle is always awesome. Today, it was especially awesome to see good ole fashioned words on paper telling an effective brand story in this impatient, digital world of ours. The burrito king’s cups and wrapping paper are playfully covered with musings about all-things-Chipotle, from the pleasure of foil licking to the reservoir of deliciousness at the bottom of each burrito. The kind of things that we Chipotle-lovers can relate to—and, more importantly, help to build brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Copy is still a powerful tool. You just need to seek out those rare moments when your audience is happy to read them. Like when they have a big, fat, juicy burrito in their hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clever commercials stay with us. If they give us a good laugh, we’ll probably share them. Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k74ZbpkOG5M">this one.</a></p>
<p>Of course, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryNtVK55OUY">a creepy commercial</a> stays with us too – and we share them so that we’re not the only ones tormented by the imagery.</p>
<p>I get it, the car is his baby. But did the baby need to be that gigantic? Did no one else cringe watching this commercial?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wieden + Kennedy 12, an experimental advertising school run by Portland ad agency W+K, has taught us a valuable lesson in what it means to succeed.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2548 aligncenter" alt="art_and_copy (1)" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/art_and_copy-1.jpg" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>These guys took failure to a whole new level when they bought out all available clear push pins on the west coast in 2006. Over 100,000 thumbtacks were used during a 351 hour period to create a wall mural that spells out Fail Harder, a message that underlines the importance of failure during the creative process.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The background is made of push pins. &#8220;The easy way would have been to do the lettering as push pins and leave the wall blank. They chose the hard way. It&#8217;s a perfectly executed concept,&#8221; says David Kennedy of Wieden+Kennedy. &#8220;It&#8217;s like Babe Ruth trying to hit a homerun. If you miss, you miss, but at least you swung the bat as hard as you could.&#8221;</p>
<p>As cool as this mural is, this wasn&#8217;t the first time W+K used the idea of failure as motivation. Check out their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlX1S8mJrIQ">1999 Nike ad</a> featuring the one &amp; only, Michael Jordan.</p>
