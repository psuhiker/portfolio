				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emotion makes ordinary people do extraordinary things. Combine that with the power of sport—“the one thing that can make the world put aside their differences and unite”— and you’ve got one heck of a story to tell.</p>
<p>If you’ve watched anything on NBC in the last 2-3 months, you’ve probably seen at least one of their advertisements for the Sochi Winter Olympic Games. Powerful is the only word I can use to describe them. As an avid sports fan, Olympic enthusiast, videographer, and former copywriter, I can honestly say these 30-second spots are some of the most compelling advertisements on TV today. Their messages are beautifully crafted and the visuals work so well with the inspiring voiceover—I only hope I can produce something like them some day.</p>
<p>Through these Sochi ads, NBC is telling a story that strikes a chord in every person who has ever had a dream. You don’t have to like sports to understand the appeal. I dare you to watch one of these ads and NOT get goosebumps…</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5K9GPJiRLno?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I caught this ad for Sports Authority during a recent Clippers-Thunder game and it tugged at me in a way that few commercials do. I&#8217;m not a Luddite, fanatical holiday shopper, or obsessive sports fan. I just appreciate a nice message that captures something pertinent about our time, and this one does.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual annual slate of electronics, this holiday season sees the arrival of two new video game consoles, which are now released every six years or so. At the same time, culturally we seem to be more and more experiencing a sort of post-tech-explosion malaise. For many people, the honeymoon bliss of social networks and mobile computing is fading and they&#8217;re trying to reconnect with the more organic joys in life.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, this ad from <a href="http://www.factorylabs.com/" target="_blank">Factory Design Lab</a> seems especially well-timed and on-point. So well done, guys. I don&#8217;t have any kids to give basketballs to, but if I did, I&#8217;d have to give it some serious thought.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What did the Office of Catholic Education do when they need to increase numbers at Catholic High Schools? They called FVM and the full-fledged marketing and awareness campaign “Choose My Future” was born. Now in its third year, the enrollment-boosting campaign is email nurturing, content marketing and advertising at its best and can be seen on planes (over the Jersey shore), trains and buses across Philadelphia.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regulatory policies are complicated for food service businesses. So when Japan-based data management company TandD Foods wanted to break into the U.S. market, FVM took a unique approach. Rather than worry about complexity, we chose to focus on a simple solution: the easiest way to keep perishable food safe and compliance in check. We targeted decision makers through an integrated digital strategy, topped with refreshed, relevant branding.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Creating effective video content requires a lot of planning.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating effective video content requires a lot of planning. It may sound obvious, but planning can be the make or break of a marcom strategy using video assets.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to plan for a successful video:</p>
<p><strong>1. Focus on your viewer and forget the rest </strong><br />
Too often, we want to appeal to everyone with one big, great video. Rather, split it up so you can focus on reaching that specific viewer. Video is not the expensive, resource-taxing venture it once was. Cut videos down and make them sharp. Like <a title="The Cost of Renting" href="http://kellerwilliams.vzaar.me/915941" target="_blank">Keller Williams’ video</a> that appeals to prospective real estate buyers tired of all the hoopla.</p>
<p><strong>2. Choose a format and stick with it</strong><br />
If you can help it, don’t switch gears mid-way through production. Changing the format will cost money, irritate talent and waste valuable time that could be used in post-production. Seems obvious, but often videos try to do too much with different formats and the video ends up being nothing more than a great bounce rate booster. A combo is ok. But be clear. Is it an interview? Documentary? Animated storyteller with interview segments? Whatever it is, stick to it.</p>
<p><strong>3. Get everyone on board</strong><br />
Is your video formal? Humorous? Poignant? Professional? Choose a style and make sure everyone involved–from talent to film crew—gets it. This is perhaps the most challenging step, as it can be hard to convey to creative or film crews or talent. Don’t be afraid to reinforce it. Over and over, if necessary.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a handful of great social media platforms out there, but I’ve always been an advocate for YouTube. I read somewhere that on average, people watch four more hours of online video than regular TV every week. When you think about it, YouTube can be a pretty powerful thing. Take Bieber for example. This pint-sized crooner made it out of small-town Canada and into our hearts, all thanks to YouTube. Other teenage talents, like comedian Bo Burnham, songstress Esmee Denters, and the lovable Gaga-singing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxDlC7YV5is" target="_blank">Greyson Chance</a> have all had similar success.</p>
<p>So I know what you’re thinking. “Yeah, YouTube is great and fun to watch, but what’s in it for me?” My advice to you? Throw your hat in the ring. It only takes one video to go viral and your world can be turned upside down. Whether you’re a small business looking for a creative way to advertise, or a large corporation looking to attract a new generation of customers—YouTube could be the answer you’ve been looking for. It just takes one idea: one funny, thought provoking, interesting idea to get the attention of the hundreds of thousands of people who visit YouTube every day. So what have you got to lose? Grab a camera, draw up a storyboard and get started!</p>
