				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve always doodled. I doodle in meetings and when I&#8217;m on the phone. Some of my doodles blossom into full-fledged drawings. At my previous job, this practice was frowned upon. The boss thought I wasn&#8217;t paying attention. But I was. My current bosses accept and even encourage it. This blog post will provide you, the reader, with different levels of detail about this topic, broken down as follows:</p>
<p><b>For the person who thinks reading a blog is like a homework assignment and just wants to look at pictures of some of the doodles that I&#8217;ve made:</b></p>
<p><b>For the person who can&#8217;t be bothered reading long, boring blog posts, read this:</b></p>
<p>Doodling helps people retain information during meetings (stop here) (or, for the person that is skeptical and would like a little more clarification):</p>
<p><b>For the person who is skeptical and just wants a little more detail:</b></p>
<p>When you doodle, you don&#8217;t daydream. Daydreaming may seem absentminded and pointless, but it actually demands a lot of the brain&#8217;s processing power. You start daydreaming about a vacation, which leads you to think about potential destinations, how you would pay for the trip, whether you could get the flight upgraded, how you might score a bigger hotel room. These cognitions require what psychologists call &#8220;executive functioning&#8221; — for example, planning for the future and comparing costs and benefits.</p>
<p>Doodling, in contrast, requires very few executive resources but just enough cognitive effort to keep you from daydreaming, which — if unchecked — will jump-start activity in cortical networks that will keep you from remembering what&#8217;s going on. Doodling forces your brain to expend just enough energy to stop it from daydreaming but not so much that you don&#8217;t pay attention.  (stop here) (or, for entire articles on the subject):</p>
