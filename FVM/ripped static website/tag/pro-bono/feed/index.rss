				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When local businesses partnered with Big Brothers Big Sisters to create a fundraiser called &#8220;Fashion For A Cause,&#8221; FVM jumped at the chance to be involved on a pro bono basis. For the past three years, we’ve executed a strategy—including website, video production, social media management and promotion—for the annual sell-out event. All proceeds go towards creating mentoring matches for children facing adversity, and nearly $100,000 has been raised so far.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t think people even realize it but the power of volunteering has an extraordinary rippling effect. Not only does the recipient benefit, but the volunteer gets a renewed sense of accomplishment and pride. They bring that feeling to the workplace, which helps build a positive environment for everyone. So it makes sense that employers should encourage community service to help increase morale.</p>
<p>Whether you participate as a team effort on a pro-bono project or you partake in an individual day of service, you are ultimately contributing to a positive work environment. Most people like the idea of giving back to their community but find it difficult to carve out the time. Thankfully, more employers realize this and offer the opportunity to participate in community service within the workplace.</p>
<p>FVM has been fortunate enough to work with a wonderful group of people at Big Brothers Big Sisters/Ambler Gives. They think they’re lucky because they got a free awesome new website, but in reality, our team got the reward. We got to flex our creative muscles beyond our usual realm of B-to-B and into a trendy fashion show event. Our developers explored new software for online donations and ticket purchases. So while we learned new skills and flourished creatively, Ambler Gives kicked off a stellar event benefitting young children. Everyone won.</p>
<p>Benefits of community service:<br />
1. Stronger communities = stronger business opportunities<br />
2. Team building – working on a goal outside of your everyday office routine<br />
3. Morale boost – Pride and personal satisfaction that comes from helping someone in need<br />
(Proven to positively impact your physical and mental health)</p>
