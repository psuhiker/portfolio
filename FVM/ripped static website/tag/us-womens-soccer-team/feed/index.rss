				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 1999 Women’s World Cup team captured fans’ hearts with their down-to-earth, girl-next-door persona. Now, thanks to the the U.S. Soccer Federation’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ussoccerdotcom?feature=g-high-crv" target="_blank">phenomenal online media presence</a>, we fans feel more connected than ever to these incredible players.</p>
<p>Never have athletes been so accessible. Hop on to U.S. Soccer’s YouTube channel and watch practice footage, sideline clips, and player interviews. You can even travel with the team as they make their way to the 2012 Olympics via their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ussoccerdotcom/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=50&amp;shelf_index=7" target="_blank">“Behind The Crest” series</a>. Still can’t get enough? See how some players live in the off-season as they take you to their hometowns in the “Back Home” series.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal to some, but think about the last time you felt like you were part of your favorite team. Professional athletes are becoming more and more removed from society—forgetting the fans and focusing solely on endorsement deals and big paychecks. It’s nice to see some sports organizations, especially federal governing bodies, like US Soccer, sticking to their roots and keeping in mind those that fuel fire of their success: their fans.</p>
