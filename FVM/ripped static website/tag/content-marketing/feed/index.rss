				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Advertising is going to change more in the next 20 years than it has in the last 100,&#8221; <a title="says Chris Taylor of Mashable OP-ED." href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/15/the-future-of-advertising-pay-per-gaze-is-just-the-beginning/" target="_blank">says Chris Taylor of Mashable OP-ED. </a>In recent months Google, the world’s largest search engine provider, was granted a patent for a Google Glass-based ad system known as &#8220;pay-per-gaze.”</p>
<p>Google Glass is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display, which is being developed by Google as part of a mission to produce a mass-market ubiquitous computer.  To operate Google Glass, wearers simply tilt their head 30 degrees upward or tap the touchpad and say, &#8220;O.K., Glass.&#8221;  After the glasses are activated simple requests can be made such as, &#8220;Take a picture”, &#8220;Record a video&#8221;, or &#8220;Send a message to.”  That&#8217;s where &#8220;pay-per-gaze&#8221; comes in.  Google’s &#8220;pay-per-gaze&#8221; would charge advertisers for the number of times someone looks at their ad through Google Glass, the same way pay-per-click works today when users click on a link.  Google Glass contains technology that would track the direction the wearer’s pupils are pointing, and for how long they are gazing at a message.</p>
<p>This technology could potentially be a major risk for Google as people are infinitely exposed to advertising.  The money would flow in endlessly, and advertisers might second-guess themselves and their decision to invest in &#8220;pay-per-gaze.”  Still, this technology is something not even Marty McFly would have imagined.  Personally, I&#8217;ll stick with my Ray Bans.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 1999 Women’s World Cup team captured fans’ hearts with their down-to-earth, girl-next-door persona. Now, thanks to the the U.S. Soccer Federation’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ussoccerdotcom?feature=g-high-crv" target="_blank">phenomenal online media presence</a>, we fans feel more connected than ever to these incredible players.</p>
<p>Never have athletes been so accessible. Hop on to U.S. Soccer’s YouTube channel and watch practice footage, sideline clips, and player interviews. You can even travel with the team as they make their way to the 2012 Olympics via their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ussoccerdotcom/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=50&amp;shelf_index=7" target="_blank">“Behind The Crest” series</a>. Still can’t get enough? See how some players live in the off-season as they take you to their hometowns in the “Back Home” series.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal to some, but think about the last time you felt like you were part of your favorite team. Professional athletes are becoming more and more removed from society—forgetting the fans and focusing solely on endorsement deals and big paychecks. It’s nice to see some sports organizations, especially federal governing bodies, like US Soccer, sticking to their roots and keeping in mind those that fuel fire of their success: their fans.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a handful of great social media platforms out there, but I’ve always been an advocate for YouTube. I read somewhere that on average, people watch four more hours of online video than regular TV every week. When you think about it, YouTube can be a pretty powerful thing. Take Bieber for example. This pint-sized crooner made it out of small-town Canada and into our hearts, all thanks to YouTube. Other teenage talents, like comedian Bo Burnham, songstress Esmee Denters, and the lovable Gaga-singing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxDlC7YV5is" target="_blank">Greyson Chance</a> have all had similar success.</p>
<p>So I know what you’re thinking. “Yeah, YouTube is great and fun to watch, but what’s in it for me?” My advice to you? Throw your hat in the ring. It only takes one video to go viral and your world can be turned upside down. Whether you’re a small business looking for a creative way to advertise, or a large corporation looking to attract a new generation of customers—YouTube could be the answer you’ve been looking for. It just takes one idea: one funny, thought provoking, interesting idea to get the attention of the hundreds of thousands of people who visit YouTube every day. So what have you got to lose? Grab a camera, draw up a storyboard and get started!</p>
