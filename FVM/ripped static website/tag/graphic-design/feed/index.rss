				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Univar Environmental Sciences is widely known for providing top-quality chemical products, but their brand lacked humanity. So, FVM engaged in research, asked some tough questions, and created an authentic and differentiated brand position—brought to life through vibrant design. The result: a stronger, warmer, more down-to-earth brand that showcased the human element so crucial to Univar’s success, and laid the foundation for all future marketing efforts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every month or two I sit down at my computer and go on Ebay, Amazon, Facebook and Google Images to see my work displayed.</p>
<p>Am I proud? Yes. Annoyed? Immensely.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I designed some images of fish and thought it would be fun to reproduce them as decals to sell. What I never would have anticipated was that others would pillage my designs from the internet to sell as their own or to promote their businesses, sometimes in ways I never would have imagined. My coworkers say I should be flattered when others do this, after all, they must really like my designs. Every time I see it happen, my heart drops. I could be creating new work, but instead I spend my time navigating the internet in search of my stolen gems. As a designer, the lure of the treasures that are readily available to us on the intenet is quite tempting. All it takes is a right click (control/click if you’re old school) and what you see magically appears on your desktop to do with as you please. We’ve probably all done it at one time or another—I’m no exception. You hear about internet piracy all of the time but it never really resonates until it lands on your shore.</p>

<p>Come on people what the hell does a striped bass have to do with carpet anyway?</p>
