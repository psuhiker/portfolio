				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to be a more effective writer? Here are five tips to get you there.</p>
<p><strong>1. Keep it plain English</strong><br />
Write it like you’d speak it. It’s not about dumbing down – it’s about helping people understand what you’re saying on a first reading.</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep it short</strong><br />
Say the most with the fewest words possible. Why use 50 words when 10 will do? A great line from the classic <em>Elements of Style</em>: “A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, for the same reason a machine should have no unnecessary parts.”</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep it active</strong><br />
Active writing involves the reader. For example, “your email was received by us yesterday” is passive and distant. Whereas, “we received your email yesterday” is active and immediate.</p>
<p><strong>4. Keep the pace</strong><br />
If one sentence has, say, 15 words in it, write a shorter one after it. Like this one. It helps keep the pace and draws your reader through.</p>
<p><strong>5. Keep it relevant</strong><br />
Always put yourself in the reader’s shoes. What’s in it for them? Make sure you give them a reason to keep reading.</p>
