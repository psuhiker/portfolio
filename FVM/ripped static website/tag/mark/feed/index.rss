				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Our Senior Art Director, <a title="Mark Parker" href="http://www.thinkfvm.com/people/mark-parker/">Mark Parker,</a> is an interesting guy. When he&#8217;s not in the office, he collects and sculpts driftwood. When he&#8217;s in the office, he sketches everything from corporate logos to his coworkers&#8217; prominent foreheads. He&#8217;s an artist, both commercial and fine, and he&#8217;s one of the driving forces in our creative department. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Recently, David West, SVP of </span>Worldwide<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Marketing and Business Development for one of our clients, CommVault, saw Mark&#8217;s latest exhibit on display in our office. He asked Mark to install a similar exhibit in CommVault&#8217;s new corporate headquarters. Mark said yes, and now <em>Brink</em> is catching the eye over at 2 Crescent Place, in Oceanport, NJ. Here are some photos from the installation, and an interview with Mark about the project.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/supplies.jpg" class="swipebox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3612" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/supplies.jpg" alt="supplies" width="2717" height="1922" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/supplies.jpg 2717w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/supplies-220x155.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/supplies-1024x724.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2717px) 100vw, 2717px" /></a></p>
<p><b style="line-height: 1.5em;">How did the idea for ‘Brink’ come about?</b></p>
<p>MP: I was going to do a project where I came up with illustrations for national parks. My first assignment was supposed to be for a national park in Puerto Rico. I was going to be drawing two species for them: the Coqui frog, and Leach&#8217;s Single-leaf Bat––which are both endangered. The project never materialized, but when I was coming up with the images, I started to like the style I was doing, and I decided to make the concept into a full exhibit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/clips.jpg" class="swipebox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3616" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/clips.jpg" alt="clips" width="2430" height="2815" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/clips.jpg 2430w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/clips-189x220.jpg 189w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/clips-883x1024.jpg 883w" sizes="(max-width: 2430px) 100vw, 2430px" /></a></p>
<p><b>How would you summarize the style of the drawings?</b></p>
<p>MP: I tried to capture each animal in as few lines as possible, which required a lot of drawing, re-drawing, and editing. Each line has to be descriptive, meaningful and graceful. Then once I got the lines down I could go crazy with color––but the foundation is always the drawing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/first-one.jpg" class="swipebox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3610" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/first-one.jpg" alt="first-one" width="2850" height="2138" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/first-one.jpg 2850w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/first-one-220x165.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/first-one-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2850px) 100vw, 2850px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Can you talk more about your choice of color? </b></p>
<p>MP: When I paint, I usually go  with complex colors. I don’t usually use really bright primary colors, because I don’t think they’re as mysterious, they’re too in-your-face. But with these, I kind of went away from my norm, and I think it helped because they’re so simple, and almost childlike. They’re almost icons of these animals, so they demanded a louder color. I also thought about where they were going to be hung. They’re in the hallway of a corporate building, so I wanted them to inject some brightness and life into what’s otherwise just a very functional space.</p>

<p><b>What did you use as models for the drawings?</b></p>
<p>MP: I used a lot of online reference. Ideally, you should draw from life, but unfortunately I’m not going to be drawing any Passenger Pigeons from life, because they’re all dead. The good thing is that today, with the internet, you can punch in whatever you want to see, and you’ll find pictures of the animal from pretty much every conceivable angle, which is really helpful. I also visited the academy of natural sciences, where they have some of the species, stuffed, on display.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/gharial-closeup.jpg" class="swipebox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3615" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/gharial-closeup.jpg" alt="gharial-closeup" width="2100" height="1575" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/gharial-closeup.jpg 2100w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/gharial-closeup-220x165.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/gharial-closeup-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What do you hope that people come away with after viewing the exhibit?</b></p>
<p>MP: I want them to learn that these animals exist (the ones that aren&#8217;t extinct, that is), and that they’re in danger. Some of these animals, people have never heard of; some of them aren’t the prettiest to look at. People always want to save the pretty things––the polar bears and koalas––but my goal is to bring these other lesser-known or lesser-appreciated animals to the forefront. To try to show that they are beautiful, through these illustrations.</p>
