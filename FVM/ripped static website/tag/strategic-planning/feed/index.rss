				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a piece of paper I keep pinned at my desk. It’s filled with numbers, stats to be precise, and serves as a daily reminder that email marketing is a powerful tool. One that should be at the heart of every suitable strategic campaign, integrated as a conversation tool in nurturing customers.</p>
<p>The rise of social networks, mobile and instant messaging has shifted focus away from email, and while these channels are becoming increasingly important for marketers to engage on, it remains essential to harness the force of the mighty inbox.</p>
<p>When planned properly and executed in the right way, emails become a highly targeted, cost-effective and powerful communicator that gets results.</p>
<p>Here, the numbers I’ve collected speak for themselves.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Super Bowl is more than just a game, it&#8217;s a global event.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Super Bowl is more than just a game, it&#8217;s a global event. It&#8217;s the most watched program of the year. Even those who have no idea who the Denver Broncos or the Seattle Seahawks are will tune in. Why? Typically it&#8217;s because everyone else is doing it, but another reason is the advertising. In 2013, the average cost of a 30-second spot was $4 million. The effectiveness of these ads in boosting a company&#8217;s sales has been in question over the past few years. Experts have compared the investment of the cost of an ad vs. overall increased revenue after the Super Bowl, and it shows little to no change. Forbes magazine claims that most companies would be better off airing 10 commercials at $400,000 each, to increase repetition. Forbes also claims that Super Bowl Ads have become memorible for presentation, but forgettable in terms of persuasion.</p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire <a href="http://www.uwec.edu/newsbureau/release/past/2000/00-01/010400super.html">did a study of over 500 Super Bowl spots that ran between 2000 and 2009</a>, and found that many did not work. Some Super Bowl Ads fail due to the fact that people typically recall the story, but not the product. More often than not, Super Bowl ads attempt to deliver broad humor for entertainment purposes, rather than sell the product. Sometimes companies will enlist celebrities to sponsor their Super Bowl Ad, but experts have also concluded this tactic is ineffective as the celebrity may lack relevance to the product. Still the question must be asked, is the Super Bowl ad worth the investment?</p>
<p>Forbes magazine says yes.</p>
<p>The real reason companies invest in Super Bowl spots is because the announcement of buying airtime for the Super Bowl can boost their stock price, at least in the short term. A business will typically announce their Super Bowl buy weeks prior to the big game, and even debut the advertisement early on social sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Experts have found that any positive impact on a businesses stock price comes at the announcement of the Super Bowl spot, not after the spot runs. Whether or not an advertisement is successful is secondary to the impact it has on a business&#8217; exposure in the stock market. So yes, for an enterprise business that can afford the $4,000,000+ on advertising their investment is well worth it.</p>
<p>Whether you watch for the love of the game, advertising, or Peyton Manning––sit back, relax and enjoy the entertainment. It&#8217;ll be a long time until your next fantasy football draft night, and that&#8217;s depressing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everybody who’s flown a lot probably knows an airline’s take off instructions by heart. However, government-required informational videos can be something that enhances your brand, and not just a checkmark on the “must have” list.</p>
<p>Case in point: Delta Airlines’ holiday-themed safety video:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn’t help myself.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn’t help myself. I opened my eyes at 5am one morning, the TV still on from the night before, and what program was on? <em>The Pitch</em>, AMC’s reality show that gives a behind-the-scenes view as two ad agencies vie for a new account. How could I NOT watch?</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3131" alt="0614_fuller-brush2" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/0614_fuller-brush2-147x220.jpg" width="147" height="220" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/0614_fuller-brush2-147x220.jpg 147w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/0614_fuller-brush2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 147px) 100vw, 147px" /></p>
<p>In this case, the account was The Fuller Brush Company. <em>THE</em> Fuller Brush Company! An iconic brand from my childhood whose distribution channel was The Fuller Brush Man (thousands of them, actually) selling door-to-door-to-door-to-door. Seriously.</p>
<p>Fuller, one of America’s oldest and most trusted brands that was once known by every household in America (and according to my mother, “Made the best toilet brush on the planet,”) is now virtually unknown by anyone under the age of 45. With a new owner who just rescued the 100-year-old company from bankruptcy, the agency assignment was to “reboot the brand for the modern market.” Again, who wouldn’t love this show?</p>
<p>Without going blow by blow through the episode, suffice it to say, I found it both entertaining and a bit unbelievable. Particularly the part when both agencies came up with exactly the same “Live Fuller” concept to build their pitches around. Yeah, kinda’ fishy.</p>
<p>Anyway, the question is, how does CEO David Sabin choose between two agencies <em>that just presented the exact same big idea?</em></p>
<p>My answer (and here comes the lesson): Clients don’t choose agencies based on the creative they pitch. They choose agencies based on whether they can imagine trusting the agency’s people with their brand.</p>
<p>Think about your closest relationships, your best friends. The best ones are those who spend the most time with you, expend the most energy on you, appreciate you and love you just the way you are. And more than likely, they are also the ones whom you allow to carefully, kindly, and almost naturally help you grow into a better version of yourself. Because they are the ones you trust.</p>
<p>In my view, the Monogram agency didn’t win because of their creative execution. They won because they showed the client he could trust them because they took the time to understand. They spent time on research and then shared their views of potential new customers; they first understood and then echoed the client’s love of The Fuller Brush Man icon while recommending a modern makeover; and they even showed personal empathy and appreciation for the quality of the brand by mentioning using a Fuller hairbrush for over 50 years.</p>
<p>Monogram got it. They understood that the pitch wasn’t about the idea, the destination. It was about their process, their journey to understanding – recounting what they did, what they learned and then what they recommended based on years of experience and expertise.</p>
<p>Monogram got it all &#8212; the brand, the client’s trust, and the account.</p>
