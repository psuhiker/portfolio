				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn’t love a list? We sure do – especially when we’re named as one of the leading B2B Brand Engagement agencies in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Chief Marketer 200 – the publication’s first comprehensive editorial list of the nation’s top 200 marketing agencies – highlights the best engagement and activation agencies based on several criteria, including client testimonials, case studies, creative concepts and executions, caliber of work, and thought leadership. The program has been created to help marketing professionals navigate to the most suitable agencies for their brands.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we’re delighted to be recognized for the work that our team does in creating and fostering brands, and connecting them with B2B audiences. And of course, none of this would be possible without our incredible clients who inspire us every day.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="http://www.chiefmarketer.com/cm200/?q=winners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FVM is 30 years old! Finally, we’re mature, sensible adults. So happy birthday to us. And our big news is that we’re opening a second location in beautiful Portland, OR to expand our B2B brand and marketing offering and better serve west coast businesses.</p>
<p>Portland is a city with thriving tech and B2B industries, top creative talent, and without a doubt one of the best food cart scenes we’ve ever binged on. Looking right at you <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/nongs-khao-man-gai-portland">Nong’s</a>. <em>And,</em> Portland is well connected to other major business hubs like Seattle and San Francisco. For us, the expansion is an opportunity to do more of what we’re passionate about: working with savvy clients to build and sustain standout brands. We’ll seek out companies to partner with in complex and competitive B2B industries and help position them to compete, grow, and win, just like we always have.</p>
<p>But apart from spreading out to the west coast, it’s business as usual. We’ll keep on keepin’ on with the same hard working, forward thinking approach that got us this far.</p>
<p>Here’s to the next 30 years! And welcome to the world FVM Portland.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are humbled and grateful to celebrate 30 years of trustful clients, dedicated employees, and the brilliant B2B branding successes we created together, from the ground up. In 1987 it began with inspiration, and it has been sustained by core principles that have motivated us for three decades.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7086" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/FVM-13-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/FVM-13-1.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/FVM-13-1-220x147.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/FVM-13-1-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6944" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/FlemingVanMetre-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/FlemingVanMetre-1.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/FlemingVanMetre-1-220x124.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/FlemingVanMetre-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>As two original partners, we were excited by an advertising discipline often abandoned by our then twenty-something peers. They sought the panache of consumer advertising and all its trappings — selling cars and cosmetics and Canadian Club — while we chose the supposedly boring path of business-to-business advertising.</p>
<p>In reality, the widely diverse products and services we have learned about on behalf of our clients require far more than clever, witty or cute. They demand deeply inquiring minds and a relentless desire to turn complex and unapproachable into simple and desirable. How could that be boring? It has been motivating to us for three decades. And it has been essential to our clients’ businesses.</p>
<p>In our B2B world, people seldom buy impulsively. Instead, they seriously consider their purchase because it could make or break a business. We have always made meaningful contributions to that critical dialogue, and it continues to give us great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Throughout the journey, another dynamic has occurred as we’ve surrounded ourselves with intelligent advertising people. We have evolved, learned, and transformed with the times. The essence of what made us flourish has never changed but the tools that deliver results for our clients often have. Dare we say it – we&#8217;ve gotten smarter.</p>
<p>So yes, please be impressed by 30 years of successful brand building at FVM. But in the end, be inspired more by our amazing clients. In our rich history, they have always invited us to their tables. We have become insiders, and thus emboldened to try even harder and dig even deeper.</p>
<p>In challenging industries, deeply vertical markets, with complex multi-channel distribution, and even in the hybrid world of business-to-business-to-consumer, we have a real voice because of our clients’ trust and confidence in us.</p>
<p>We believe that confidence has been fostered by the fundamental truths we’ve always embraced at FVM – three powerful promises that have made us successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be <em>principled</em>. Doing what’s right has been in our DNA since day one.</li>
<li>We will be <em>inquisitive</em>. We just have to know “why” and we won’t settle for partial answers.</li>
<li>We will be <em>honest</em>. We will share our real concerns with our clients. There is no time for games or half-truths.</li>
</ul>
<p>There it is. We have dug deep into our clients’ businesses to build and market remarkable B2B brands – always with the promise of principled, inquisitive, and honest work. Lofty? Indeed. Boring? Not a chance. After all, it is B2B.</p>

<p>ProLease is one of many great businesses we’ve been fortunate enough to add to our roster recently. Others include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://golightpath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightpath</a>, a major New York regional business telecom company offering high-performance connectivity for medium to enterprise-level businesses, who hired FVM for corporate and product brand positioning, visual identity, web design, and campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://clerycenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Clery Center for Security on Campus</a>, a national non-profit organization that works with college and university communities to create safer campuses, who joined us for brand positioning, visual identity, web design, and marketing strategy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lsslibraries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Library Systems and Services (LS&amp;S)</a>, a national company that partners with local government to improve operations and services for their Library systems, who came onboard for brand positioning, web design, and marketing strategy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ncea.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA)</a>, the world’s largest private-professional education organization, who took us on for brand positioning, and visual identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We love working with such a diverse range of B2B businesses. Finding unique ways to solve varied marketing obstacles across complex industries is what gets us up in the morning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At FVM, refrigerator real estate is getting scarce. Some people have to stand at agency meetings for lack of available chairs. And sometimes there’s a line for the ping pong table. But we don’t care because we have FOUR. NEW. HIRES!</p>

<p><em>Connectivity </em>continues to deliver stellar content through beautiful design and technology; while <em>Total Value</em> leveraged key customer research and an awesome efficiencies calculator to educate and engage tech buyers—paying off in hundreds of qualified leads.</p>
<p>These awards reflect two things we pride ourselves on delivering for our clients: powerful content marketing and effective lead-gen campaigns. And because awards can’t be won without trusting and talented clients, my hat goes off to them.</p>
<p>B2B isn’t about print ads, conservative blues, or one-size-fits-all plug and play work. It’s human and it’s helpful. It’s about people. And that’s always at the heart of our strategies.</p>
<p>We have a lot of fun learning what buyers like, how to reach and engage them, and what to do once we have their attention. That&#8217;s where we get our kicks, and awards are the icing on the cake.</p>
