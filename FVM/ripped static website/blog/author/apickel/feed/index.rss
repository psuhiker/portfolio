				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Research is playing an increasingly larger role in brand and marketing strategy, so it’s important we stay on top of trends and new technologies. That’s why I recently attended the <a href="http://www.thequirksevent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quirk’s Event</a> in Brooklyn ⎯ a conference dedicated to all things market research ⎯ to meet with vendors, demo software, talk with peers, and listen to industry experts.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7497" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/Quirks-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="457" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/Quirks-1.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/Quirks-1-220x126.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/Quirks-1-768x439.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Here are four trends that marketers need to be aware of, and what they mean for B2B brands and marketing strategies.</p>
<h3>1: Man vs. machine</h3>
<p>Technology around market research is rapidly advancing. Digital behavior tracking, AI, and even neuroscience can provide real-time glimpses into audience behaviors, decision-making processes, and paths to purchase. But just because you can utilize these tools doesn’t necessarily mean you should.</p>
<p>Keeping goals and objectives in focus remains the most crucial aspect of crafting an effective approach. Being clear on the goals the research needs to accomplish, the questions you want to answer, the perspectives you have to uncover, as well as the behavioral data already at your disposal, will help you be selective with the technology you need, if any. Knowing exactly how the insights will inform the brand or marketing strategy will help protect timelines and budgets, too.</p>
<h3>2: More data, more depth</h3>
<p>Marketers are already struggling with what to do with the abundance of research data and analytics at our fingertips… and yet more data keeps coming.</p>
<p>Don’t be daunted!</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the point isn’t to indiscriminately gather every data point under the sun. Yes, there’s a responsibility to understand and then harness relevant data, but the real challenge is to identify the story within, and shape a narrative that offers direction to a brand or marketing initiative.</p>
<h3>3: It’s not just a numbers game</h3>
<p>Technology and data are only really there to help us understand what drives audiences to make the decisions they do. It’s the human behind the number that we’re trying to get to ⎯ uncovering their worldviews, emotions, and needs.</p>
<p>And B2B audiences are famously complex, with one purchase typically requiring approval from a mix of influencers, users and decision-makers ⎯ often disconnected from one another ⎯ all dealing with different pressures. So it’s easy to miss crucial subtleties and nuances when relying solely on numbers and quantitative sources.</p>
<p>For that reason, it’s still vital for marketers to have direct, open dialogue ⎯ like one-on-one interviews ⎯ which remains core to any B2B research. That’s where tone is conveyed, human connections are formed, and deeply insightful conversations about audience drivers can (and usually do) happen.</p>
<h3>4: Stop, collaborate, and listen</h3>
<p>Insights and analytics professionals have become integral to many organizations, with more and more companies investing in and growing internal departments to help inform business strategy.</p>
<p>So marketers now have more owned data and insight than ever before, and can increasingly utilize it to identify challenges the brand is facing, verticals or channels that need the most attention, and areas where outside agencies can help.</p>
<p>This trend has ushered in era of greater collaboration between internal and external research, with more data being understood, shared, and used to shape strategy.</p>
<h3>Looking ahead</h3>
<p>Market research is a more valuable resource for B2B brands than ever before ⎯ technology is bringing us closer to audiences, and businesses are integrating more insights and analytics to drive business growth. As an agency, we’re seeing more B2B companies reach out to us recognizing the value of research in informing brand and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>It’s our job to understand the new tech, embrace the data, learn fresh methods, and collaborate more. But to be truly effective marketers, it is crucial that we never lose sight of the overall strategy and goals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Focus groups often get an unfair rap. In high-stakes B2B environments, the phrase can conjure up images of wasted time and wasted money.</p>
<p>But focus groups provide a valuable opportunity to learn firsthand from customers and prospects about the issues that matter most. As a primary, qualitative research tool, focus groups can be used to uncover the emotional and rational reasons behind behavior, brand loyalty, and the buyer journey.</p>
<p>Extracting value from focus groups requires proper prep work, skilled moderating, and a detailed analysis integrated with other discovery work. This ensures that the time, effort, and resources required for a B2B focus group pay off in insights that drive results.</p>
<p>Here are the critical steps you can take to make sure that your focus group pays off for your business, and how to demonstrate the value of a focus group.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7344 alignleft" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/Focus-Group-e1516894509534.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p><strong>Set Objectives<br />
</strong>A clear, distinct objective allows for a more focused discussion, leading to deeper understanding of the issues at hand. Defining a clear-cut purpose can filter out surface-level findings and helps avoid leaving a negative impression among participants (who are likely customers).</p>
<p>The objective depends on the progress made during the discovery process, but typically falls into one of three categories:</p>
<p><u>Understanding broad, common topics</u><br />
Early in discovery work, focus groups provide a wide view of the industry, audience, and issues, revealing overarching trends. This approach usually requires extensive follow-up and isn’t recommended for B2B, where these themes can be discovered elsewhere.</p>
<p><u>Validating or refuting themes</u><br />
A focus group that occurs sometime in the middle of discovery work can confirm or deny previously uncovered findings among a broader set of customers. This is likely the best use of a B2B group.</p>
<p><u>Testing creative<br />
</u>Towards the end of discovery and into brand development, you can test the industry tropes and customer preferences uncovered during prior discovery work. The focus group can tell you which directions resonate and which fall flat.</p>
<p><strong>Recruit Participants<br />
</strong>The right mix of participants can make or break a focus group. It’s important that the group is representative of the audience as a whole, but with enough commonalities that the conversation will be productive. Group participants also need to be able to talk openly and honestly among peers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Recruiting for Focus Groups: B2B vs. B2C</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span>Participant recruiting is probably where B2B focus groups differ most from traditional B2C. Keep these tips in mind when you begin your recruiting process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be persistent.</strong> Targeted audiences make for a much smaller pool of possible participants. Professionals are often busy, making them difficult to reach and unlikely to participate.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of biases.</strong> Most participants are recommended and recruited by the sales force because they’re already fans of the brand meaning results could be positively skewed.</li>
<li><strong>Remember the bigger picture.</strong> Only one person from a given customer type or prospect may be represented, even though the purchase decision typically involves multiple roles and functions.</li>
<li><strong>Provide incentives.</strong> Monetary gifts are nice, but the general rule is that professionals need to feel valued and appreciated. A sincere thank you along with specifics on how their participation will ultimately benefit their own business goes a long way.</li>
<li><strong>Be sensitive to privacy concerns.</strong> Having competing businesses in the same group can become problematic if participants aren’t comfortable discussing their challenges or successes in front of the competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>For B2B, consider factors including job title, role, and company size. It’s possible that multiple groups will be needed to achieve the correct balance of sample representation and commonalities for a productive discussion.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of FVM’s large telecom clients segmented its audience into two buckets: enterprise and SMB. These two groups both faced challenges when it came to telecomm needs but approached them from very different contexts. Our client needed to engage with both audiences and sought to determine the best way to approach each.</p>
<p>So we conducted two separate focus groups: varying participants’ job titles, longevity with our client, and industries represented between both groups.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Craft the Discussion Guide<br />
</strong>Realistically, a B2B focus group will be 2.5 hours total, including time for introductions, breaks, and closing remarks. It’s important to be realistic about what can and cannot be accomplished in this window. Plan for five to six main topics, with probing questions or workshop-style exercises to spur dialogue. Remember: the guide, while important, is merely a tool. It’s up to the group and moderator to engage in dialogue that covers the key topics.</p>
<p>Allow participants to dictate the flow and pace of the conversation by crafting a fluid guide that starts out broader and moves into more specific lines of questioning. Let participants determine the length and depth of each conversation, highlighting which topics are most important.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7341" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/fvm-034-focus-group-image.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="745" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/fvm-034-focus-group-image.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/fvm-034-focus-group-image-220x164.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/fvm-034-focus-group-image-768x572.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h6>A nonlinear guide format helps the moderator follow the room, rather than being restricted to a predetermined order of events.</h6>
<p>Use the objectives discussed above as the key starting points for your discussion guides.</p>
<p><u>Understanding broad, common topics<br />
</u>Include open-ended questions that ask participants about their roles, challenges, and competition.</p>
<p><u>Validating or refuting themes<br />
</u>Carefully choose topics that require further explanation. Plan to discuss each one, allowing enough time to hear from each participant and follow up on responses. Don’t waste time on topics that can be explored elsewhere.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><u>Testing creative<br />
</u>Share creative directions to determine how certain images, concepts, and colors make the participants feel. In B2B, focus groups are the perfect opportunity to establish which industry themes are most expected, needed, or overused.</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, we used a focus group to test one industry’s most common uses of imagery: blurred lights, moving traffic, and stock photography of smiling business people. When we ran these tropes by group participants, we discovered that the photos of smiling people were problematic. Group members asked, “Are the people supposed to represent me or the vendor?” On the other hand, the images denoting speed resonated well.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Moderate the Discussion<br />
</strong>Skilled moderators are able to elicit information beyond “top of mind” responses, uncovering rational, behavioral, and emotional drivers. In order to reach this second and third-level information, keep these functions in mind while moderating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the objective and enough about the subject matter to speak intelligently on it.</li>
<li>Make no assumptions and remain unbiased, maintaining an open mind to all opinions and thoughts.</li>
<li>Demonstrate respect for the participants, proving their time is valuable and their voices are being heard.</li>
<li>Maintain a high energy level throughout varied tasks and question types, including open-ended questions and questions that allow participants to jot down answers.</li>
<li>Manage the conversation, diving deeper where necessary and tactfully cutting off irrelevant topics or commentary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for a follow-up piece with more on moderating B2B focus groups, including a breakdown of the most common B2B focus group participants.</p>
<p><strong>Analyze the Results<br />
</strong>Focus groups represent just one facet of discovery, so it’s important to integrate your findings with data from all other sources. By comparing and contrasting results with interviews, web analytics, and other discovery methods, you’ll find that themes and trends will emerge.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for these common clues in focus group output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polarizing conversations that left participants on different sides of the issues often indicate topics that need further exploration and validation.</li>
<li>Topics on which participants spent more time are most likely hot-button issues.</li>
<li>Conversations among the participants could suggest areas where there is a desire to learn more from peers. It could also signify a place for the client to enter the conversation as a thought leader.</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus groups can provide valuable information in a short amount of time. With the appropriate preparation, participant mix, moderation, and analysis, you can gain valuable understanding of your client’s industry, competitors, audience, and challenges laying the foundation for a powerful brand or campaign.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[We have a deceptively simple solution for creating strong B2B brands: listening.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have a deceptively simple solution for creating strong B2B brands: listening. That’s why it’s 90% of our brand discovery process. We listen to uncover every angle, perspective, and nuance so that the brand we create <em>truly</em> resonates with the people who matter most: buyers.</p>
<p>Content audits, digital reviews, and competitive research play a major role in brand discovery, too (and there’ll be more posts to follow on those), but here’s a little insight into how we break down the “question and answer” side and how each tactic informs the branding process.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6491 alignleft" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/StockSnap_84GOP2OAKR.jpg" alt="Startup Stock Photos" width="1000" height="662" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/StockSnap_84GOP2OAKR.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/StockSnap_84GOP2OAKR-220x146.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/StockSnap_84GOP2OAKR-768x508.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Group Strategy Sessions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What are they?</em></strong></p>
<p>A chance to hear about the business and brand from the client’s perspective. And it’s not necessarily just about the CEO and CMO. We want to hear from leaders and key employees within as many departments as possible, from sales to finance to customer service. Because a brand isn’t just what the leadership says it is; the brand lives in the people who represent it.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do we listen for? </em></strong></p>
<p>Through conversation and customized brand exercises, we’re looking for a holistic view of where the brand is currently sitting, what challenges and competition it is facing, what the business aims are, and what the brand needs to achieve for the company.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How does it inform the branding process?</em></strong></p>
<p>A strong internal perspective creates a reliable brand benchmark. From here, we cast a wider net and see how other perspectives measure up.</p>
<p><strong><u>Personal Interviews</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What are they?</em></strong></p>
<p>Interviews usually happen next after a strategy session. They present the opportunity to talk one-on-one — in-person or by phone — with key stakeholders: the client (again), their customers, and their partners. Client (or “internal”) interviews give us a chance to dig deeper into key issues uncovered during the strategy session, while customer (or “external”) interviews focus on our client’s brand, offering, and the ways their products and services are used. But more importantly, the interviews also focus on the customer’s <em>own</em> business: challenges they face on a regular basis, their wants and needs, solutions they love or hate, and their perspectives on the industry.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do we listen for?</em></strong></p>
<p>First, we compare what we heard internally and externally, asking: Is what our client says about themselves the same as what their customers say? Second, we use this more intimate conversation as an opportunity to get past surface-level responses and uncover the true emotions surrounding a business, industry, and brand.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does it inform the branding process?</em></strong></p>
<p>A brand must connect with its audience. A company might believe they know the right way to differentiate their brand, but the attributes they’re calling out may not matter to target audiences. One-on-one interviews help us identify where the current brand succeeds and fails in connecting, as well as where opportunities exist to build a brand strategy that is true to both the client — and to customers’ needs.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6494 alignleft" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-483395705-copy.jpg" alt="man having presentation at seminar" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/iStock-483395705-copy.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/iStock-483395705-copy-220x147.jpg 220w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/iStock-483395705-copy-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong><u>Focus Groups</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What are they?</em></strong></p>
<p>Focus groups are a great <em>qualitative</em> research weapon. We guide a small group representing a sample of our client’s audience through conversations, interactions, and exercises so they can discuss a client’s brand and provide feedback on any initial brand strategy routes or creative concepts.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do we listen for?</em></strong></p>
<p>We’re looking to gain a deep understanding of experiences and perceptions, listening for common trends and points of agreement and disagreement. At its best, a focus group points­­­­­­ us straight towards brand and industry hot spots, showing what issues make people the most passionate, either in a good way, or bad way.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does it inform the branding process?</em></strong></p>
<p>Focus groups add another layer of depth to our findings and help hone strategy. We test strengths and weaknesses in our findings and ideas, identify points where more clarification or research is needed, and confirm pitfalls the brand should avoid. And with the right mix of people in the room, we can feel good knowing we’ve heard from all potential audience groups.</p>
<p><strong><u>Surveys</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What are they?</em></strong></p>
<p>Low-cost, quick, and completely scalable, surveys are our go-to quantitative data approach. Since surveys are anonymous, they present a chance to collect very open and honest input from stakeholders and encourage a more straightforward, rational response.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do we listen for?</em></strong></p>
<p>The standardized format of surveys allow us to ask pointed questions, enabling easy identification of trends across broad groups.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does it inform the branding process?</em></strong></p>
<p>A survey can be useful early in discovery to get a broad view of opinions on multiple key issues. Surveys are also valuable as a final checkpoint so we can take the temperature and confirm we’re heading in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong><u>The truth will emerge</u></strong></p>
<p>Asking questions and listening intently allows us create a brand that aligns a company’s performance and aspirations with the needs and expectations of its customers. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>We take all of the insights we hear — hold them up against findings from a client’s greater marketplace — and distill them into authentic, compelling brand attributes, which can then be interpreted, tested, and tweaked with certainty.</p>
<p>A brand that truly resonates really is just a few conversations away. All we have to do is listen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a friend of mine bought a set of Crayola bath toys for my daughter, I was pretty psyched.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6161 size-full alignleft" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/390608_xF8w7xphUyNJwxkZQzPTFDmQR.jpg" alt="390608_xF8w7xphUyNJwxkZQzPTFDmQR" width="700" height="700" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/390608_xF8w7xphUyNJwxkZQzPTFDmQR.jpg 700w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/390608_xF8w7xphUyNJwxkZQzPTFDmQR-80x80.jpg 80w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/390608_xF8w7xphUyNJwxkZQzPTFDmQR-220x220.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Of course we already had a <em>seemingly</em> identical set of bath squirters lying around the house, but these were going to be different… somehow. They were made by Crayola, and I was convinced they were special in some hidden way.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-6162 size-full alignleft" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/81y2cUIgxlL._SL1500_-e1465340731286.jpg" alt="81y2cUIgxlL._SL1500_" width="800" height="721" /></p>
<p>My family didn’t understand — they couldn’t figure out why I was scrutinizing the packaging, or why I was studying the toys so closely. “They’re just animals that float and squirt water, Alex,” they told me.</p>
<p>But I knew they were wrong. There had to be something about this product that tied into color — it was Crayola after all.</p>
<p>Sure enough, I found the line I was looking for on the package: <em>Watch for the color-changing stripes. </em>It was the key factor that made these bath squirters different.</p>
<p>It’s surprising how often we get asked the question “what do you mean by brand?” And Crayola provides a perfect example.</p>
<p>Crayola has so closely associated itself with color that <em>you just know</em> any product they produce will be defined by the colors it makes, identifies, or becomes. It seems obvious, but this unwavering focus allows them to extend the brand beyond core products like crayons and markers.</p>
<p>The tie is so strong that, even when moving into the market of rubber bath toys, the user’s colorful expectations persist. How many brands can boast this kind of achievement?</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6163 alignleft" src="http://www.thinkfvm.com/wp-content/uploads/original_390608_juIpmIklOPlwLHBi0c5ffGqOd-1.jpg" alt="original_390608_juIpmIklOPlwLHBi0c5ffGqOd (1)" width="768" height="296" srcset="http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/original_390608_juIpmIklOPlwLHBi0c5ffGqOd-1.jpg 768w, http://localhost:8888/thinkfvm/wp-content/uploads/original_390608_juIpmIklOPlwLHBi0c5ffGqOd-1-220x85.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>A brand is so much more than a logo or even its visual identity. It&#8217;s also the promises, explicit and inherent, that brand has made to users. “This product is all about color” may not be an impressive statement — but the fact that it can go unstated and still be conveyed… that’s impressive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FFF asks all the questions you didn’t need to know the answers to, one FVMer at a time. This time, our Director of Client Services, Alex. She’s the mother of Bailey dog and Macy dog, and daily asker of the question: “Guys: what are you having for dinner tonight?”<br />
One woman. Eight questions. Go!</p>

<p><strong>1. What was the last thing you did for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>I went to Vancouver and had a beer with Clamato juice in it. That’s reconstituted tomato juice and clam broth, with beer. It was a little briny and a lot salty. Make of that what you will.</p>
<p><strong>2. What&#8217;s that one thing you always tell people you&#8217;re going to invent but never do?</strong></p>
<p>A remote control that operates lamps so you don&#8217;t have to get up, but apparently it’s already a thing. And I still don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>3. What superficial/trivial thing could you not live without?</strong></p>
<p>A white noise app on my phone.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you could teach something, what would you teach?</strong></p>
<p>That it isn&#8217;t as hard to cook tasty meals as people think. You just need SmittenKitchen.com, a few go-to recipes and some basic techniques.</p>
<p><strong>5. What&#8217;s the one food you will never ever eat?</strong></p>
<p>Mozzarella sticks. OK, there’s actually no food I would never eat, but they’re just gross.</p>
<p><strong>6. What&#8217;s your biggest office pet peeve?</strong></p>
<p>Meetings that are scheduled for thirty minutes and go two hours. Be realistic about how much time you need for a meeting, people!</p>
<p><strong>7. What do you do when you&#8217;re not at the office?</strong></p>
<p>Kickboxing, cycling, cooking, spending time with family…and checking work emails.</p>
<p><strong>8. Give us a song and tell us why you choose it?</strong></p>
<p>This is my pump up song: Countdown by Beyonce</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I love Real Simple magazine.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love <em>Real Simple </em>magazine. It&#8217;s the only magazine I find myself reading cover-to-cover each month. The recipes, photos, articles, layout. It all just&#8230;works for me. I&#8217;m constantly seeing things I like, whether its a new recipe, a book to check out, a cool conversation-starter stat, or a gift for a friend&#8217;s upcoming birthday. My current method of saving these &#8220;likes&#8221; is to turn up the bottom corner of the page (since the top corner is turned down to mark my spot). I always think &#8220;oh, if I just turn up this corner, and save this magazine, I&#8217;ll remember to come back to this gift idea!&#8221;</p>
<p>Until I go on a cleaning spree, and recycle all those stupid magazines cluttering up my coffee table, end table, TV console, floor. Man, they pile up fast. And then, months later, on the day-of said friend&#8217;s birthday, I find myself racking my brains &#8220;WHAT was is that I saw in <em>Real Simple </em>that was the perfect gift for her?&#8221;</p>
<p>So, when they introduced new technology that allowed you to use your phone to scan and save items you like from the magazine (it was real simple: you download an app, and there is an indicator on pages that have scannable content &#8212; anything could be scannable, a scarf and where to buy it, a recipe, a book cover and title), my first thought <em>should </em>have been &#8220;this is the 2014 solution to my page corner turning system! Stacks of magazines no more!&#8221;</p>
<p>But I work at FVM.</p>
<p>So, instead, my first thought was, &#8220;how can my clients use this and benefit from this technology, to make <em>their  </em>customers&#8217; lives real simple?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is what we do here &#8212; make our clients customers&#8217; lives easier, and often that means looking for inspiration where your life has been made real simple.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;What do you mean you don&#8217;t have DVR?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;What do you mean you don&#8217;t have DVR? You don&#8217;t record shows? You actually watch them live? YOU WATCH COMMERCIALS?&#8221; My friend asked, his voice rising in astonishment with each question, particular disdain put forth on that last word — &#8220;<em>commercials?</em>!&#8221;</p>
<p>A simple response from me changed the tide of the conversation all together, and it turns out, validates what we do here at FVM.</p>
<p>&#8220;I work in advertising. I love commercials. There are some real gems you&#8217;d miss if you only ever watched shows on DVR.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment&#8217;s pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what ad I love? The hump dayyyyy one,&#8221; he enthusiastically said.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, we were still talking about them. The commercials he so desperately avoids thanks to the DVR. Not only was he laughing and smiling about the ads themselves, but he also recalled the product, company, service being advertised. By name! And we had spent time discussing each one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why I do what I do. And it&#8217;s why I love what I do. Advertising is fun, and it works.</p>

		<title>The new to-do list</title>

		<description><![CDATA[For other positions within the agency, there always seems to be something &#8220;new&#8221; out there.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For other positions within the agency, there always seems to be something &#8220;new&#8221; out there. Whether it&#8217;s a new web application framework, an update to design software, or even video editing software or techniques. Our developers and designers have to know the latest and greatest technology, learn it, and keep up with it.</p>
<p>But for my role, the good old standbys of email (I guess at one point this was new), a notepad, and a pile of as-brightly-colored-as-possible Post-Its are the tools I rely on each day. I think most account executives would agree that the to-do list is our most important tool for staying on top of everything.</p>
<p>In the absence of technological advances in pen and paper (thank goodness), it&#8217;s up to me to find a better way, and I think maybe I have. I recently read an article on to-do lists, that said in today&#8217;s work environment, they have become somewhat obsolete. Why? Because we put too many items on them. The article suggested that we put no more than 3 items on our to-do list on any given day. And more than that, narrow down the tasks to the <em>first</em> task of each item on that list. That first task actually becomes the to-do; it flows from there.</p>
<p>It seems so counterintuitive — less on my list to get more done? How could that possibly work? And what about all the other stuff I am not getting to?*</p>
<p>Well, I tried it, and guess what? It works.</p>
<p>Not only did I complete my entire to-do list, but I did each job thoroughly, giving it the attention it deserves. This alone lead to a lot less hassle, back and forth, revising and re-working later on. And, I had plenty of room in my day for those requests, questions, and emergencies that never fail to crop up. Here too, I had the time needed to get the job done right the first time.</p>
<p>The beauty of my new to-do list is that it forces me to prioritize. What REALLY has to get done today? That goes on the list. Those other tasks don&#8217;t. And what I&#8217;ve noticed is that those tasks that used to end up moving from day-to-day-to-week usually: a. don&#8217;t need to get done at all because they have sorted themselves out, or b. are part of a bigger project that gets completed when and where they should.</p>
<p>Each night I still get a little bit of anxiety when I write out my list, but I hold myself to the 3-item limit, and am loving the increased productivity.**</p>
<p>*I think my favorite part about the article was that you could have a side list of the little nigglers you don&#8217;t want to forget about. PHEW. At least they have a home, even if I never visit them there.</p>
<p>**Confession, I allow myself up to 5 items, because…well I&#8217;m not <em>that </em>great at adopting new &#8220;technologies&#8221; sometimes. Actually 6 items…one day I just <em>needed</em> 6. But I didn&#8217;t get them all done.</p>

		<title>The importance of doing nothing</title>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently ran across this article on Philly.com.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently ran across <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/jobs/INQ_Jobbing_At-QVC-new-execs-do-nothing----bosss-orders.html">this article</a> on Philly.com. Mike George, the CEO of local company QVC instructs all new hire top execs to “do nothing” for the first 6 months on the job.</p>
<p>By “do nothing,” George is actually asking quite a bit of his top execs. He’s asking them to sit back, learn and absorb. At first, that seems easy. But for any driven professional, not accomplishing something to move the business forward, “simply” absorbing is quite the challenge.</p>
<p>More, George then asks them to take their nothing and turn it into….something. I love George’s three buckets that he suggests all that learning will fall into:</p>
<ul>
<li> Stuff you thought the company was doing wrong, but is “actually like the secret sauce that’s amazing.”</li>
<li>Things that could be done differently, but are working okay – no need to touch</li>
<li> Things that could be done differently or better. Here is where you should be playing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exec on-boarding philosophy mirrors FVM’s philosophy. You can’t start changing things until you truly understand them. When we on-board a new client, our first task is awfully similar to QVC’s new top execs task.</p>
<p>And here is how FVM defines “doing nothing:”</p>
<ul>
<li> Get to know your client: website, advertising, brochures, collateral. Get your hands on all of it, read it, understand it, live it. Talk to people: interviews, phone calls, meetings. Sales reps, marketing, advertising, finance, etc. Every department is critical. See it. Visit locations, touch the products.</li>
<li>Get to know your client’s competition: website, advertising, brochures, collateral. Get your hands on all of it, read it, understand it, live it.</li>
<li>Get to know your client’s customers and prospects: who are they? Where are they? What makes them tick? Why do they love your client? Why do they love the client’s competition?</li>
<li>Get to know the industry: understand the association, publications, resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s so easy for any outsider to view any company and make snap judgment decisions about what changes, stays, and goes. But they’d be missing out on the “secret sauce” that makes things move, and more, they’d be missing out on the areas that truly need work.</p>
<p>Only once you live and breathe what your client, competitors, customers and prospects live and breathe can you properly address challenges and holes, making the right changes in the right places.</p>
<p>There’s a reason QVC makes $8.5 billion in revenue, and, there’s a reason FVM’s clients stick around so long.</p>

		<title>Amazon takes the feminine approach</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may have been named for the world’s longest river, but it <i>should</i> have been named for the mythological Amazon––tall, beautiful, striking, and most importantly, with a female brain.</p>
<p>She’s tall: her wingspan reaches from my front porch, to my living room TV, to my nightstand. Whether it&#8217;s a package arriving, Downton Abbey on the Prime channel on the Roku, or the latest dystopian society trilogy on my Kindle, this Amazon is large enough to reach every facet of my home.</p>
<p>She’s beautiful: have you been on the site recently? Her simple form and elegance jumps out from the minute I type in the URL all the way to when I check out. The simple navigation, beautiful photographs, and page layouts give me the information I need without having to hunt for it, and the confirmation page is simple and speedy.</p>
<p>She’s striking: it’s truly unbelievable what this warrior can do. She knows my favorites and anticipates what I&#8217;ll want next. Then, she gets it into my hands with one mouse click and (at most) two days&#8217; time.</p>
<p>But underlying her ability to perform her task so beautifully? A female brain: organized, logical, and on top of every detail. And, in true Amazon warrior fashion, she wasn’t afraid to remind me.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/98BIu9dpwHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Sure, Amazon lets you know through this commercial that they are anticipating the latest and greatest technology, and plants the seed that if anyone could do it, they could. But even more strikingly, they&#8217;re reminding you that they have already perfected their craft.</p>
<p>The most telling piece of this ad is not at 0:33 when the product is loaded into the drone, but everything before that. Here, Amazon gives us a sneak peak at what makes drone delivery possible. It just so happens to also make 10-day, 7-day, 2-day and 1-day delivery possible. It doesn’t matter whether the product leaving the warehouse gets on a drone, a truck, or a donkey. What matters is how quickly and accurately it left the warehouse. They’ll do it right in the future, because they’re doing it right now.</p>
<p>And so Amazon has reminded us of their core, and in so doing reminded us to never forget ours. Despite where your brand goes, knowing its core and sticking to it no matter what will help you go a long way….maybe all the way down the Amazon river.</p>
